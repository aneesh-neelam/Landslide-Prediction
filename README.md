A java app that performs classification and prediction. Using Bayesian Classification technique.

Just a small project to gain experience. Done as a project for the Data Warehousing and Data Mining course.

Things done:

* Found the count of every attribute with respect to each Output
* Calculated probability for each Output
* Calculated probability for all attributes with respect to each Output
* Functional Java Swing UI
* Predicting Output (Message Dialog)


Things left:

* Better UI (Java Swing is annoying)


Requirements:

* The Landslide Zone data in a local MongoDB instance
* json-simple (1.1.1)
* mongo-java driver (2.12.0)
